Alright, so if you are reading this, you probably know that I love coding [still an understatement]. However, I also love reading [no, I'm not teacher's pet], in particular a science magazine by the name of _Nautilus_. No, this isn't your boring science book that you can't understand at all. This is a nonprofit organization that features the best reads that I have ever read. Their articles range from Quagga mussels (Yes, you read that correctly, _quagga_ mussels) in the Great Lakes all the way to the way that our world runs on code [Find that at their blog, _Facts so romantic_]. You should definitely go to their websites. Here they are: <a class="linklink" href="https://www.nautil.us">Nautilus' website</a>
